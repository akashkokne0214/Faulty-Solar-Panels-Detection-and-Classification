# Faulty-Solar-Panels-Detection-and-Classification

### Faulty Solar Panel classification using Deep Learning
In this project, we investigate & classify faulty solar panels using deep learning algorithm & deep learning models can learn to distinguish between different types of patterns. Deep learning model could be trained to distinguish between the patterns of cracked panel, dirty panel, burned-out panel, bird dropping on solar panel and snow cover on solar panel, electrical damage on solar panel surfaces also identify the location of a cracked panel within a solar plant.

Deep learning is a powerful tool that can be used to improve the efficiency and reliability of solar panel systems. By identifying and localizing faults early on, deep learning can help to prevent costly repairs and downtimes. This can be potential to revolutionize solar panel fault detection. By automating the process and improving accuracy, deep learning can help to improve the efficiency and reliability of solar panel systems.
##### Benefits of using Deep Learning for Solar Panel Fault Detection

Achieve high accuracy in detecting faults, even in cases where human inspectors may miss them. 

Quickly scan large amounts of data to identify potential faults. 

Easily scaled to handle larger and more complex datasets. 

Automate the fault detection process, which can save money on labor costs. 

##### Objective
Advanced analytics, monitoring and cleaning solar panels is a crucial task, hence developing an optimal procedure to monitor and clean these panels is very important in order to increase modules efficiency, reduce maintenance cost and reducing the use of resources. The accumulation of dust, snow, bird drops, shadow etc. on the surface of solar panels reduces the efficiency of the solar modules and hence the amount of produced energy.
